### Results of our three usability tests.

For the first test, we presented our paper prototype starting on the first page, and presented the user with the page that corresponded to the button that they had pressed. The test was performed in the HM library, where a student may use this app, since they would likely use HM Comms in a school setting. We chose this user because she is a junior, part of many clubs, attends many I period meetings, and is part of the record and would likely need to send out polls. Therefore, this student represents users who would benefit from this app. Juliette performed the usability test with the junior, and sent the recording to Nick and Ethan. One thing we learned about the testing process is that it is most beneficial if the person facilitating the test speaks minimally so that the user can take control and add commentary and tell us their thought process. I think this usability test was pretty successful, so next time we wonâ€™t make any drastic changes, but we could encourage the user to add even more narration so that we can extract as much constructive criticism as possible. We also made some revisions such as adding instructions to the clubs page as the user was confused by this page. 

 Second test was conducted by Nick, and he recorded the process and sent it to Juliette and Ethan. The test was conducted in an HM classroom, another space where students would likely use this app. The user, in addition to being an HM student, is head of the linguist, and thus would use this app to schedule club meetings and send out info about club rooms. The manner that the test was conducted in was very similar to the previous test. Nick prompted the user to add as many critiques as possible in order for us to get the most information.
