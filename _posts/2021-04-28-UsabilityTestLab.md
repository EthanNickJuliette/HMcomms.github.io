### Results of our three usability tests.

For the first test, we presented our paper prototype starting on the first page, and presented the user with the page that corresponded to the button that they had pressed. The test was performed in the HM library, where a student may use this app, since they would likely use HM Comms in a school setting. We chose this user because she is a junior, part of many clubs, attends many I period meetings, and is part of the record and would likely need to send out polls. Therefore, this student represents users who would benefit from this app. Juliette performed the usability test with the junior, and sent the recording to Nick and Ethan. One thing we learned about the testing process is that it is most beneficial if the person facilitating the test speaks minimally so that the user can take control and add commentary and tell us their thought process. I think this usability test was pretty successful, so next time we won’t make any drastic changes, but we could encourage the user to add even more narration so that we can extract as much constructive criticism as possible. We also made some revisions such as adding instructions to the clubs page as the user was confused by this page. 

 Second test was conducted by Nick, and he recorded the process and sent it to Juliette and Ethan. The test was conducted in an HM classroom, another space where students would likely use this app. The user, in addition to being an HM student, is head of the linguist, and thus would use this app to schedule club meetings and send out info about club rooms. The manner that the test was conducted in was very similar to the previous test. Nick prompted the user to add as many critiques as possible in order for us to get the most information. 
 
 The last trial was conducted by Ethan, and the test was conducted at his home, a place where the app wouldn’t be commonly used, but could be used. The user, a sibling of Ethan and an HM student, is a senior and is the FTC robotics captain, and leader of the PERIOD club, so this app was interesting to her in particular because she could use it for scheduling her meetings and helping other leaders of her clubs in the future have an easier time scheduling meetings. In this test, the trial was done with minimal speaking between Ethan and his participant as it allowed for more independent use of the app. Also, it allowed Ethan to gain more information from his participant’s actions and the questions she asked. Ethan prompted the participant to say whatever was on their mind, and how they felt about their interactions and about each page. In fact, the user suggested that there should be another option for extra info on setting a meeting for a club page, so we are going to most likely add that to the same page or add another page for that option. The main revision that was made was with the removal of the arrow on the main page as it led to some confusion in previous tests. As a result of this removal, the participant in Ethan’s test had no comments on this aspect of it.

### Modifications
Some of the most important modifications that came out of the test trials were fixing the club page. Since the first user simply did not know what to do during the usability testing, it was crucial that we edited this page to provide clearer instructions stating what the user should do at this point. It was quite an easy fix, but proved to be necessary for our app to be clear.  I think the scheduling a club page also provided lots of helpful feedback. This wasn’t as much a critique about a glaring error in our prototype, but rather a very helpful suggestion to make our app better. We would revise this page to add a short few sentences about the club meeting that the student is signing up for. This would help reduce confusion or ambiguity for the students to make going to club meetings even simpler.
