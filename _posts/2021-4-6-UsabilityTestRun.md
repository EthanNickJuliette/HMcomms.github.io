### Explanation

For this test, we presented our paper prototype starting on the first page, and presented the user with the page that corresponded to the button that they had 
pressed. The test was performed in the HM library, where a student may use this app, since they would likely use HM Comms in a school setting. We chose this user 
because she is a junior, part of many clubs, attends many I period meetings, and is part of the record and would likely need to send out polls. Therefore, this 
student represents users who would benefit from this app. Juliette performed the usability test with the junior, and sent the recording to Nick and Ethan. One 
thing we learned about the testing process is that it is most beneficial if the person facilitating the test speaks minimally so that the user can take control 
and add commentary and tell us their thought process. I think this usability test was pretty successful, so next time we wonâ€™t make any drastic changes, but we 
could encourage the user to add even more narration so that we can extract as much constructive criticism as possible.
